## Introduction

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. This literature review focuses on AI-based methods that leverage multiple data types to enhance cancer detection. By combining imaging data (like MRIs and CT scans), genomic information, and clinical data, we aim to provide a more holistic view of cancer diagnostics.

## Project Overview

The **MultiModal-CancerDetection-LitReview** project compiles recent studies and advancements in the field of AI for cancer detection. It evaluates how different modalities can work together to provide better diagnostic accuracy. The project also discusses challenges, limitations, and future directions in this rapidly evolving area.

## Research Areas

This literature review covers several key areas, including:

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Overview of AI techniques applicable to cancer detection.
- **Cancer Detection**: Current methods and technologies used in identifying cancer.
- **Computer Vision**: Role of imaging techniques in diagnosing cancer.
- **Deep Learning**: How neural networks are transforming cancer detection.
- **Machine Learning**: Traditional ML methods in the context of medical diagnostics.
- **Medical Imaging**: Importance of imaging modalities like MRI, CT, and PET scans.
- **Multimodal Approaches**: Integrating different data types for improved accuracy.
- **Research**: Summary of key studies and findings in the field.

## Key Findings

1. **Enhanced Accuracy**: Studies show that multi-modal approaches significantly improve diagnostic accuracy compared to single-modality methods.
